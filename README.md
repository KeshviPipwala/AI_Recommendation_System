# AI Recommendation System â€“ Personalized Item Suggestions using Machine Learning

## Description
The AI Recommendation System is a machine learning project that provides personalized item recommendations using Collaborative Filtering. It leverages K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to analyze user preferences and suggest relevant items based on similar users. This project is designed to demonstrate how recommendation engines work in real-world applications like e-commerce, streaming services, and online marketplaces.

## Features
Collaborative Filtering Approach: Uses user-item interactions to generate recommendations.
Machine Learning Algorithm: Implements scikit-learnâ€™s Nearest Neighbors for similarity analysis.
Customizable & Scalable: Easily adaptable to larger datasets and real-world applications.
Dataset Support: Works with both preloaded sample data and external CSV datasets.
Simple & Interactive: Accepts user input for real-time recommendations.

## How It Works
Loads User-Item Data (either a CSV file or a default dataset).
Creates a User-Item Matrix to map interactions between users and items.
Trains a KNN Model to identify similar users based on past interactions.
Suggests Items by recommending what similar users have liked.
